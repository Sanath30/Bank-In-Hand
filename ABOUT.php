      </CENTER>
      <p>The world is becoming more Tech savvy day by day. New inventions and discoveries are
        constantly happening every moment. However yet, not all of us have adopted all these
        developments. In the Banking sector, we find that all Banks have Online banking systems
        but these apps are only for existing users.</p>

      <p>Not all banks have inculcated the feature of creating a zero-balance account for the new
        users. That is why our project Bank is Hand, helps people to create their accounts in the
        bank in the online mode. The main objective of this project is to make new account
        creation more feasible for people in this bustling era. This platform will connect more
        people to different banks even if they are far away.</p>
